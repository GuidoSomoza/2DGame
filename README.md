# 2DGame


This project is a 2D game developed in Java as part of my continuous learning journey in software development. As a university student pursuing a degree in Systems Engineering, Iâ€™m using this project to further develop my Java programming skills and gain hands-on experience in game development. My goal is to apply fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, game physics, and graphical rendering, while also exploring new techniques and frameworks to improve my skills on the path to becoming a software engineer.
